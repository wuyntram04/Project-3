Container classes are classes that are used to store and manage collections of data. 
They can hold multiple values and make it easier to organize and work with them.
A key feature of a good container class is abstraction, which means the user can use the container without needing to know how it works internally. 
This makes the class easier to reuse and understand. For example, in C++, 
the vector class is a container that can hold a list of elements and automatically handles resizing when you add or remove items.
